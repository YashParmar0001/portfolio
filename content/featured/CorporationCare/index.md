Developed JCC and JCC Admin apps during the SSIP Gujarat Hackathon 2023 for the Jamnagar Municipal Corporation.

JCC enables residents to register and track complaints, while JCC Admin helps employees manage complaint statuses, streamlining processes and potentially increasing complaint resolution rates by an estimated 50%. Built with Flutter and Bloc for responsive UI and efficient state management.

Utilized [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for real-time data handling and [OneSignal](https://onesignal.com/) for push notifications with an estimated 99% delivery rate. Advanced to the finals, showcasing innovation in civic technology.
