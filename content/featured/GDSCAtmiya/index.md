Conceptualized and developed GDSC Atmiya as the app development lead within the core team, creating an event management solution for the college's GDSC chapter.

Built with Flutter and Bloc for responsive state management, and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for secure storage and retrieval of event data for an estimated 50+ events annually. Integrated [OneSignal](https://onesignal.com/) for push notifications, ensuring timely communication and engagement.

Streamlined event management by enabling members to receive notifications and RSVP directly through the app, potentially increasing event participation by 30%.
